          Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm a front-end web developer passionate about simplifying
          complex problems. My expertise extends beyond the typical front-end
          scope, allowing me to innovate and explore new solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am open to cooperation with clients across
          <b
            class="tooltip"
            title="
           * Business-to-Business allows for easy cooperation without work permits"
          >
            all the continents*</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I have led the development of applications from defining
          <b>business and user requirements</b> to <b>UX and API design</b>, and
          finally, to <b>creating efficient and scalable product</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive in environments that value open and sincere communication and
          collaboration with teammates, yet I am equally comfortable working
          independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my recent projects have utilized technologies such as
          TypeScript, React, Next.js, Testing Library, Vitest, Playwright,
          Vercel, and GitHub Actions. Additionally, I have had the opportunity
          to work with other technologies like Vanilla JS, Redux, Apollo, Vue,
          Vuex, Cypress, Svelte, Firebase DB, Storybook, and AngularJS.
        </p>

        <h1>Example workflow: Jobs App</h1>
        <p>
          The Jobs app allows people to easily search for a job and apply to a
          selection of them. Additionally, both the behavior and styling of the
          app are easily customizable so that the client can create various
          instances of the app for their partners or market branches.
        </p>

        <h3>UX</h3>
        <p>
          I have helped the client clarify the business needs and create a
          common, early vision of the product. The design process involved
          creating user personas, defining the needed features, and mapping out
          user flows. I prepared a lo-fi mockup and collected stakeholders'
          feedback to further shape the interface. Afterwards, a hi-fi mockup
          adhering to the client's brand identity was created.
        </p>

        <h3>API Design</h3>
        <p>
          While clarifying the UI, I created an early description of the
          client-server communication. After receiving feedback from the backend
          developers, I prepared an OpenAPI-compliant specification. Having a
          single source of truth helped us clearly define cooperation during the
          entire development process.
        </p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>
          The client required very fast initial loading of the app, as well as
          ease of finding new developers to maintain the app in the future. I
          decided to use the popular React.js library with the Next.js frontend
          framework, utilizing static rendering wherever the initial state did
          not rely on user input. To keep the app's size small, helper libraries
          were used sparingly.
